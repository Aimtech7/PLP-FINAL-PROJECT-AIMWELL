## Video Demo Script (if recording)

**Voiceover:**

"Welcome to AimWell's new course integration feature. Today I'll show you how we've seamlessly combined internal courses with curated Udemy content.

First, as an admin, I'm adding a new Udemy course... [fill form] ...and it's live.

Now as a student, I can browse all courses in one place. Here are AimWell's courses, and here are the Udemy recommendations. I'll click this one... [redirect to Udemy] ...and that click is tracked for analytics.

Back on AimWell, I'll enroll in an internal course... complete it... and boom - automatic certificate generation with a unique verification code.

Anyone can verify this certificate, even without an account. Perfect for employers checking credentials.

Finally, if I complete a Udemy course, I just upload my completion proof here... an admin reviews it... and I get an official AimWell certificate.

That's course integration done right - internal and external, all in one platform with verifiable credentials."

# AimWell Course Integration - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of internal course content capability and Udemy course integration into the AimWell platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
Created comprehensive database tables to support both internal and external courses:

#### New Tables
- **`external_courses`** - Stores Udemy course links and metadata
  - Fields: id, source, provider_course_id, title, description, url, affiliate_tag, price_text, thumbnail_url, instructor_name, notes, is_published
  - Supports affiliate tracking with `affiliate_tag` field
  
- **`course_resources`** - Stores supplementary course materials
  - Fields: id, course_id, external_course_id, resource_type, label, url, storage_path
  - Links to either internal or external courses
  - Supports: PDFs, videos, links, and Udemy embeds

- **`course_purchases`** - Tracks all course purchases and external clicks
  - Fields: id, user_id, course_id, external_course_id, amount, currency, gateway, gateway_payload, status
  - Records Udemy redirects with `gateway: 'udemy_redirect'`
  
#### Enhanced Tables
- **`certificates`** - Extended to support external courses
  - Added: `external_course_id`, `proof_url`, `verified_by`, `verified_at`, `verification_notes`
  - Supports manual verification workflow for external courses

- **`courses`** - Enhanced with new fields
  - Added: `slug`, `price`, `thumbnail_url`, `is_published`, `category`

### 2. Admin/Instructor UI

#### Course Management Page (`/course-management`)
Admin-only interface for managing all courses:

**Internal Courses:**
- Create/edit internal courses with full metadata
- Set pricing, duration, category
- Upload thumbnails
- Manage course visibility

**External Courses (Udemy):**
- Add Udemy course links manually
- Store metadata: title, description, instructor, price
- Optional affiliate tag for tracking
- Bulk management interface

**Features:**
- Tabbed interface separating internal and external courses
- Full CRUD operations
- Real-time updates
- Form validation

### 3. Learner UI

#### Enhanced Education Page (`/education`)
Unified course discovery with tabbed interface:

**Internal Courses Tab:**
- Shows AimWell-hosted courses
- Enrollment functionality
- Progress tracking
- Certificate generation on completion (≥60% score)
- Demo completion button for testing

**External Courses Tab:**
- Displays curated Udemy courses
- "Open on Udemy" CTA with affiliate support
- Click tracking (records to `course_purchases`)
- Visual distinction with orange styling
- Shows course thumbnails and pricing

#### Certificate Verification Page (`/certificate-verification`)
Public verification portal with dual functionality:

**Verify Certificate:**
- Enter certificate UUID to validate
- Shows certificate details if valid
- Public endpoint accessible to anyone

**Upload External Course Proof:**
- Students can upload Udemy completion certificates
- Supports PDF/image uploads to Supabase Storage
- Creates pending certificate record for admin review

### 4. Certificate Management

#### Enhanced Certificates Page (`/certificates`)
Extended with external course support:
- View all earned certificates
- Download PDF certificates (internal courses)
- Verify certificates with unique codes
- Upload proof for external courses
- Track verification status

#### Verification Flow
1. **Internal Courses:**
   - Automatic certificate generation on course completion (score ≥60%)
   - PDF includes QR code linking to verification URL
   - Instant verification available

2. **External Courses:**
   - Student uploads Udemy completion proof
   - Admin reviews proof in admin panel
   - Manual verification and AimWell certificate issuance
   - Verification status tracked in database

### 5. Payment & Tracking

#### Internal Courses
- Integrated with existing payment gateways (M-Pesa, Stripe)
- Purchases recorded in `course_purchases` table
- Links to user account and subscription

#### External Courses
- Click tracking via `course_purchases` with status `'redirected'`
- Affiliate tag appended to Udemy URL (if configured)
- Future support for revenue sharing via Udemy API

### 6. Security & RLS Policies

All tables have Row Level Security enabled:

- **`external_courses`:** Public read, admin-only write
- **`course_resources`:** Public read, admin-only write  
- **`course_purchases`:** Users see own purchases, admins see all
- **`certificates`:** Users see own certificates, admins see all with proof uploads

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required for basic functionality.

**Optional for full Udemy API integration:**
```
UDEMY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
UDEMY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```

> **Note:** Current implementation works in "manual-link mode" without API keys. Udemy service layer is modular and can be upgraded later.

## Seed Data

Three sample Udemy courses are pre-loaded:
1. Complete Web Development Bootcamp (Dr. Angela Yu)
2. Python for Data Science and Machine Learning (Jose Portilla)
3. AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Stephane Maarek)

  COUNT(*) as click_count
FROM course_purchases cp
JOIN external_courses ec ON cp.external_course_id = ec.id
WHERE cp.gateway = 'udemy_redirect'
GROUP BY ec.id
ORDER BY click_count DESC;
```

### Top Sellers
```sql
SELECT 
  c.title,
  COUNT(*) as enrollment_count,
  SUM(cp.amount) as total_revenue
FROM course_purchases cp
JOIN courses c ON cp.course_id = c.id
WHERE cp.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## API Endpoints
